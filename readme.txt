#Description

In this assignment I worked with hashing and password genarator.
When we type our passwords it dosent get stored in raw text, it gets turned it a hash.
Example:SHA256("hello") 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824.
The assignmenat goal was to generate hash-values and test rainbow  tables and use Hashcat(tool) crack
MD5-hashs(Message Disesget Method 5 is cryptographic hash algorithm that genrates a 128-bit digest from a string
of any length.

#Repo

- md5-hasher.py (The python code to generate hashes and passwords)
- md5-hashcat.sh (Bash script that run hashcat to crack MD5 based hashes with mask attack)
- mina_hashar.txt (10 MD5-hash values that are use for cracking)
- mina_hashar2.txt (10 extra hash values)


#Steps

- Clone repo 
- cd Kod/fs/as20/o2
